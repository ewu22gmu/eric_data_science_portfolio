# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me. Presented in the form of jupyter Notebooks.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.*

## Contents

### Capstone on Applying NLP to explore the relationship between social media posts and the stock market. ([Repo](https://github.com/ewu22gmu/eric_data_science_portfolio/tree/main/Capstone%20Sentiment%20Topic%20Modeling%20on%20Social%20Media%20to%20Predict%20Stock%20Market%20Movement))

This project explores the effect of social media posts on the movement of the stock market. The goal of this project was to understand the impact of the sentiment and topics reflected in user's social media posts on stock price movement.

Steps: 
  1. Data cleansing of textual features
  2. Feature engineering of market measures
  3. Allignment of social media posts and the associated stock market data
  4. Significance tests between textual data and stock market movement

*Language: R*

*Tools: udpipe, tm, tidyverse, lubridate, quanteda, vader, seededlda, knitr, forcats*

### Automatic Poetry Analysis ([Repo](https://github.com/ewu22gmu/eric_data_science_portfolio/tree/main/NLP%20Automatic%20Poetry%20Analysis))

The goal of this project was analyzing the changes and similatities between 18th century poetry and modern poetry. Changes in structure, grammar, context, and sentiment were considered and analyzed.

Steps: 
  1. Text preprocessing
  2. Using the NLTK package to transform text corpora for each period of poetry
  3. Applying NLP tools to derive and describe the poetry

*Language: Python*

*Tools: pandas, nltk, scipy, matplotlib*

### Manufacturing Agent Based Model([Repo](https://github.com/ewu22gmu/eric_data_science_portfolio/tree/main/Manufacturing%20Agent%20Based%20Model))

This project was an expansion on a Agent based model used for analyzing the economic and business cycles of manufacturing on an island population. The Manufacturing agent based model facilitates the manufacturing of goods between manufacturing plant locations to store locations to consumers. 

Steps: 
  1. Initialization of the agent population 
  2. Initialization of data structures
  3. Evolution and manufacturing operations at each tick to generate data

*Language: Python*

*Tools: pandas, numpy, ast, re, os, sys, warnings, sqlite3, matplotlib*
